 Generation and Sentiment Analysis with Mistral Model
Overview
This Python script demonstrates how to utilize the Mistral language model for text generation and perform sentiment analysis on the generated text. 
The script loads a pre-trained Mistral model from the Hugging Face model hub, optimizes it for inference using the Accelerator library, and then generates text based on user prompts.
Additionally, it leverages the transformers library for tokenization and the pipeline function for sentiment analysis.

Requirements
Python 3.x
torch
transformers
accelerate


Credits
This script utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library for model loading and inference.
The sentiment analysis functionality is powered by the Hugging Face Model Hub and the pipeline function.
